## Features

* JavaScript-free
* Light/Dark colour theme
* Multilingual site
* Two ways of post list: Pagination and time line

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-theme-2038'
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-2038
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-2038

BUT WAIT! You have to put [translation file][i18n-pos] manually into `_data`
directory of your site to correctly display information, for it cannot be
included in the gem.

## Usage

(To be continued after I fixed most of bugs)

## Todo

* Support of UnicodeMath or ASCIIMath
* Right-to-left and vertical page
